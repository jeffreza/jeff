Applied K-mean Clustering using apache spark in Pyhton
Skin Segmentation plays an important role in many computer vision applications. 
The aim of skin segmentation is to isolate skin regions in unconstrained input images. 
In this project, a skin color segmentation approach by texture feature extraction and k-meaning clustering is proposed.
I improved the traditional skin classification by combining both color and texture features for skin segmentation. 
After the color segmentation using a 16 - Gaussian Mixture Models classifier, the texture features are extracted using effective wavelet transform with a 2-D Daubechies Wavelet and represented as a list of Shannon entropy. 
The non-skin regions can be eliminated by the Skin Texture-cluster Elimination using K-mean clustering. Experimental results based on common datasets show that our proposed can achieve better performance of the existing methods with true positive of 93.8% and with false positives 28.4%.
